/**
 * @brief A dialog that runs an external Lua script and shows its output.
 *
 * The script runs in a normal Lua environment with standard libraries.
 * io.write() outputs in the text area of this dialog instead of stdout.
 * For require(), everything works as if the current directory was the one
 * containing the script file.
 * This even works if the script file is located in Qt resources: in this
 * case, the script can require() other scripts that are also Qt resources,
 * using a relative path.
